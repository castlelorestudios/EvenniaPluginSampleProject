# Evennia init.d Screen launcher script (Linux)
#
# This requires a Linux using init.d. I is used togeter
# with the evennia-screen.sh script, which must be working
# before setting this one up. This script is meant to be
# used as part of Linux' automatic services and requires
# root to set up.
#
# Usage:
#  1. sudo cp evennia-screen-initd.sh /etc/init.d/evennia
#  2. cd /etc/init.d
#  3. Edit this script (now renamed to 'evennia') and
#     change SCRIPTPATH and USER below to fit your setup.
#  4. sudo chown root:root evennia
#  5. sudo chmod 755 evennia
#
# You can now use (as root) Â´services evennia start|stop|reload`
# to operate the server. The server will run as the USER you
# specify and must thus have access to start the server 
# (*don't* set it to run as root!).
#
# To make Evennia auto-start when the server reboots, run
# the following:
#
#    sudo update-rc.d evennia defaults 91
#


# CHANGE to fit your setup (obs: no spaces around the '=')
