Thanks for helping us improve Evennia! For hints of things we need help with, see the [Get and Give help][4] page.

## Making an issue (bug report / feature request):

Issues are formatted using [Markdown][7]. There is already a
template to fill in. Some commonly useful markdown syntax:

   - \**italic text*\* 
   - \*\***bold text**\*\* 
   - \[link text\]\(url\)
   - \``inline code`\` 
   - \`\`\````multiline code```\`\`\`

Please use \``@command`\` when you mention an Evennia in-game command
starting with `@`. Otherwise github will notify any github-user that
happens to be named "command"!

## Making a Pull request (PR)

A PR allows you to request that your custom fixes/additions/changes be pulled into the main Evennia repository. To make a PR you must first [fork Evennia on GitHub][8]. Read the [Contribution][3] page for more help.

If you are working to solve an Issue in the issue tracker, note which branch you should make the PR
against (`master` or `develop`). If you are making a PR for a new feature or contrib, do so against
the `develop' branch.

- All contributions should abide by Evennia's [style guide](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/blob/master/CODING_STYLE.md).
- For your own sanity and ours, separate unrelated contributions into their own branches and make a new PR for each. You can still update the branch after the PR is up - the PR will update automatically.
