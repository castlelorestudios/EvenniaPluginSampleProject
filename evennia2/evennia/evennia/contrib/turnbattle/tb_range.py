Simple turn-based combat system with range and movement

Contrib - Tim Ashley Jenkins 2017

This is a version of the 'turnbattle' contrib that includes a system
for abstract movement and positioning in combat, including distinction
between melee and ranged attacks. In this system, a fighter or object's
exact position is not recorded - only their relative distance to other
actors in combat.

In this example, the distance between two objects in combat is expressed
as an integer value: 0 for "engaged" objects that are right next to each
other, 1 for "reach" which is for objects that are near each other but
not directly adjacent, and 2 for "range" for objects that are far apart.

When combat starts, all fighters are at reach with each other and other
objects, and at range from any exits. On a fighter's turn, they can use
the "approach" command to move closer to an object, or the "withdraw"
command to move further away from an object, either of which takes an
action in combat. In this example, fighters are given two actions per
turn, allowing them to move and attack in the same round, or to attack
twice or move twice.

When you move toward an object, you will also move toward anything else
that's close to your target - the same goes for moving away from a target,
which will also move you away from anything close to your target. Moving
toward one target may also move you away from anything you're already
close to, but withdrawing from a target will never inadvertently bring
you closer to anything else.

In this example, there are two attack commands. 'Attack' can only hit
targets that are 'engaged' (range 0) with you. 'Shoot' can hit any target
on the field, but cannot be used if you are engaged with any other fighters.
In addition, strikes made with the 'attack' command are more accurate than
'shoot' attacks. This is only to provide an example of how melee and ranged
attacks can be made to work differently - you can, of course, modify this
to fit your rules system.

When in combat, the ranges of objects are also accounted for - you can't
pick up an object unless you're engaged with it, and can't give an object
to another fighter without being engaged with them either. Dropped objects
are automatically assigned a range of 'engaged' with the fighter who dropped
them. Additionally, giving or getting an object will take an action in combat.
Dropping an object does not take an action, but can only be done on your turn.

When combat ends, all range values are erased and all restrictions on getting
or getting objects are lifted - distances are no longer tracked and objects in
the same room can be considered to be in the same space, as is the default
behavior of Evennia and most MUDs.

This system allows for strategies in combat involving movement and
positioning to be implemented in your battle system without the use of
a 'grid' of coordinates, which can be difficult and clunky to navigate
in text and disadvantageous to players who use screen readers. This loose,
narrative method of tracking position is based around how the matter is
handled in tabletop RPGs played without a grid - typically, a character's
exact position in a room isn't important, only their relative distance to
other actors.

You may wish to expand this system with a method of distinguishing allies
from enemies (to prevent allied characters from blocking your ranged attacks)
as well as some method by which melee-focused characters can prevent enemies
from withdrawing or punish them from doing so, such as by granting "attacks of
opportunity" or something similar. If you wish, you can also expand the breadth
of values allowed for range - rather than just 0, 1, and 2, you can allow ranges
to go up to much higher values, and give attacks and movements more varying
values for distance for a more granular system. You may also want to implement
a system for fleeing or changing rooms in combat by approaching exits, which
are objects placed in the range field like any other.

To install and test, import this module's TBRangeCharacter object into
your game's character.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle.tb_range import TBRangeCharacter

And change your game's character typeclass to inherit from TBRangeCharacter
instead of the default:

    class Character(TBRangeCharacter):
        
Do the same thing in your game's objects.py module for TBRangeObject:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle.tb_range import TBRangeObject
    class Object(TBRangeObject):

Next, import this module into your default_cmdsets.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle import tb_range

And add the battle command set to your default command set:

    #
    # any commands you add below will overload the default ones.
    #
    self.add(tb_range.BattleCmdSet())

This module is meant to be heavily expanded on, so you may want to copy it
to your game's 'world' folder and modify it there rather than importing it
in your game and using it as-is.
