Simple turn-based combat system with spell casting

Contrib - Tim Ashley Jenkins 2017

This is a version of the 'turnbattle' contrib that includes a basic,
expandable framework for a 'magic system', whereby players can spend
a limited resource (MP) to achieve a wide variety of effects, both in
and out of combat. This does not have to strictly be a system for
magic - it can easily be re-flavored to any other sort of resource
based mechanic, like psionic powers, special moves and stamina, and
so forth.

In this system, spells are learned by name with the 'learnspell'
command, and then used with the 'cast' command. Spells can be cast in or
out of combat - some spells can only be cast in combat, some can only be
cast outside of combat, and some can be cast any time. However, if you
are in combat, you can only cast a spell on your turn, and doing so will
typically use an action (as specified in the spell's funciton).

Spells are defined at the end of the module in a database that's a
dictionary of dictionaries - each spell is matched by name to a function,
along with various parameters that restrict when the spell can be used and
what the spell can be cast on. Included is a small variety of spells that
damage opponents and heal HP, as well as one that creates an object.

Because a spell can call any function, a spell can be made to do just
about anything at all. The SPELLS dictionary at the bottom of the module
even allows kwargs to be passed to the spell function, so that the same
function can be re-used for multiple similar spells.

Spells in this system work on a very basic resource: MP, which is spent
when casting spells and restored by resting. It shouldn't be too difficult
to modify this system to use spell slots, some physical fuel or resource,
or whatever else your game requires.

To install and test, import this module's TBMagicCharacter object into
your game's character.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle.tb_magic import TBMagicCharacter

And change your game's character typeclass to inherit from TBMagicCharacter
instead of the default:

    class Character(TBMagicCharacter):

Next, import this module into your default_cmdsets.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle import tb_magic

And add the battle command set to your default command set:

    #
    # any commands you add below will overload the default ones.
    #
    self.add(tb_magic.BattleCmdSet())

This module is meant to be heavily expanded on, so you may want to copy it
to your game's 'world' folder and modify it there rather than importing it
in your game and using it as-is.

        initiative (int): The character's place in initiative - higher
        numbers go first.

    Notes:
        By default, does not reference the character and simply returns
        a random integer from 1 to 1000.

        Since the character is passed to this function, you can easily reference
        a character's stats to determine an initiative roll - for example, if your
        character has a 'dexterity' attribute, you can use it to give that character
        an advantage in turn order, like so:

        return (randint(1,20)) + character.db.dexterity

        properties from either the attacker or defender.

        This can easily be expanded to return a value based on characters stats,
        equipment, and abilities. This is why the attacker and defender are passed

SPELL DEFINITIONS START HERE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this section, each spell is matched to a function, and given parameters
that determine its MP cost, valid type and number of targets, and what
function casting the spell executes.

This data is given as a dictionary of dictionaries - the key of each entry
is the spell's name, and the value is a dictionary of various options and
parameters, some of which are required and others which are optional.

Required values for spells:

    cost (int): MP cost of casting the spell 
    target (str): Valid targets for the spell. Can be any of:
        "none" - No target needed
        "self" - Self only
        "any" - Any object
        "anyobj" - Any object that isn't a character
        "anychar" - Any character
        "other" - Any object excluding the caster
        "otherchar" - Any character excluding the caster
    spellfunc (callable): Function that performs the action of the spell.
        Must take the following arguments: caster (obj), spell_name (str),
        targets (list), and cost (int), as well as **kwargs.
    
Optional values for spells:
    
    combat_spell (bool): If the spell can be cast in combat. True by default.
    noncombat_spell (bool): If the spell can be cast out of combat. True by default.
    max_targets (int): Maximum number of objects that can be targeted by the spell.
        1 by default - unused if target is "none" or "self"

Any other values specified besides the above will be passed as kwargs to 'spellfunc'.
You can use kwargs to effectively re-use the same function for different but similar
spells - for example, 'magic missile' and 'flame shot' use the same function, but
behave differently, as they have different damage ranges, accuracy, amount of attacks
made as part of the spell, and so forth. If you make your spell functions flexible
enough, you can make a wide variety of spells just by adding more entries to this
dictionary.
