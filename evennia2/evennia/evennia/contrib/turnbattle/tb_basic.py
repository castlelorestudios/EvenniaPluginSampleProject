Simple turn-based combat system

Contrib - Tim Ashley Jenkins 2017

This is a framework for a simple turn-based combat system, similar
to those used in D&D-style tabletop role playing games. It allows
any character to start a fight in a room, at which point initiative
is rolled and a turn order is established. Each participant in combat
has a limited time to decide their action for that turn (30 seconds by
default), and combat progresses through the turn order, looping through
the participants until the fight ends.

Only simple rolls for attacking are implemented here, but this system
is easily extensible and can be used as the foundation for implementing
the rules from your turn-based tabletop game of choice or making your
own battle system.

To install and test, import this module's TBBasicCharacter object into
your game's character.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle.tb_basic import TBBasicCharacter

And change your game's character typeclass to inherit from TBBasicCharacter
instead of the default:

    class Character(TBBasicCharacter):

Next, import this module into your default_cmdsets.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle import tb_basic

And add the battle command set to your default command set:

    #
    # any commands you add below will overload the default ones.
    #
    self.add(tb_basic.BattleCmdSet())

This module is meant to be heavily expanded on, so you may want to copy it
to your game's 'world' folder and modify it there rather than importing it
in your game and using it as-is.

        initiative (int): The character's place in initiative - higher
        numbers go first.

    Notes:
        By default, does not reference the character and simply returns
        a random integer from 1 to 1000.

        Since the character is passed to this function, you can easily reference
        a character's stats to determine an initiative roll - for example, if your
        character has a 'dexterity' attribute, you can use it to give that character
        an advantage in turn order, like so:

        return (randint(1,20)) + character.db.dexterity

        By default, returns a random integer from 1 to 100 without using any
        properties from either the attacker or defender.

        This can easily be expanded to return a value based on characters stats,

    Notes:
