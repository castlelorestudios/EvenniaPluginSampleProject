Simple turn-based combat system with equipment

Contrib - Tim Ashley Jenkins 2017

This is a version of the 'turnbattle' contrib with a basic system for
weapons and armor implemented. Weapons can have unique damage ranges
and accuracy modifiers, while armor can reduce incoming damage and
change one's chance of getting hit. The 'wield' command is used to
equip weapons and the 'don' command is used to equip armor.

Some prototypes are included at the end of this module - feel free to
copy them into your game's prototypes.py module in your 'world' folder
and create them with the @spawn command. (See the tutorial for using
the @spawn command for details.)

For the example equipment given, heavier weapons deal more damage
but are less accurate, while light weapons are more accurate but
deal less damage. Similarly, heavy armor reduces incoming damage by
a lot but increases your chance of getting hit, while light armor is
easier to dodge in but reduces incoming damage less. Light weapons are
more effective against lightly armored opponents and heavy weapons are
more damaging against heavily armored foes, but heavy weapons and armor
are slightly better than light weapons and armor overall.

This is a fairly bare implementation of equipment that is meant to be
expanded to fit your game - weapon and armor slots, damage types and
damage bonuses, etc. should be fairly simple to implement according to
the rules of your preferred system or the needs of your own game.

To install and test, import this module's TBEquipCharacter object into
your game's character.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle.tb_equip import TBEquipCharacter

And change your game's character typeclass to inherit from TBEquipCharacter
instead of the default:

    class Character(TBEquipCharacter):

Next, import this module into your default_cmdsets.py module:

    from evennia.contrib.turnbattle import tb_equip

And add the battle command set to your default command set:

    #
    # any commands you add below will overload the default ones.
    #
    self.add(tb_equip.BattleCmdSet())

This module is meant to be heavily expanded on, so you may want to copy it
to your game's 'world' folder and modify it there rather than importing it
in your game and using it as-is.

        an advantage in turn order, like so:
