# Contrib folder

`evennia/contrib/` contains 'contributions': extra snippets of code that are
potentially very useful for the game coder but which are considered
too game-specific to be a part of the main Evennia game server.  These
modules are not used unless you explicitly import them. See each file
for more detailed instructions on how to install.

Modules in this folder are distributed under the same licence as
Evennia unless noted differently in the individual module.

If you want to edit, tweak or expand on this code you should copy the
things you want from here into your game folder and change them there.
