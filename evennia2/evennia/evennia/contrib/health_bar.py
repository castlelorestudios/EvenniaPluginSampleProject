Health Bar

Contrib - Tim Ashley Jenkins 2017

The function provided in this module lets you easily display visual
bars or meters - "health bar" is merely the most obvious use for this,
though these bars are highly customizable and can be used for any sort
of appropriate data besides player health.

Today's players may be more used to seeing statistics like health,
stamina, magic, and etc. displayed as bars rather than bare numerical
values, so using this module to present this data this way may make it
more accessible. Keep in mind, however, that players may also be using
a screen reader to connect to your game, which will not be able to
represent the colors of the bar in any way. By default, the values
represented are rendered as text inside the bar which can be read by
screen readers.

The health bar will account for current values above the maximum or
below 0, rendering them as a completely full or empty bar with the
values displayed within.

    Represents a current and maximum value given as a "bar" rendered with
    ANSI or xterm256 background colors.
    
    Args:
        cur_value (int): Current value to display
        max_value (int): Maximum value to display
    
    Options:
        length (int): Length of meter returned, in characters
        fill_color (list): List of color codes for the full portion
            of the bar, sans any sort of prefix - both ANSI and xterm256
            colors are usable. When the bar is empty, colors toward the
            start of the list will be chosen - when the bar is full, colors
            towards the end are picked. You can adjust the 'weights' of
            the changing colors by adding multiple entries of the same
            color - for example, if you only want the bar to change when
            it's close to empty, you could supply ['R','Y','G','G','G']
        empty_color (str): Color code for the empty portion of the bar.
        text_color (str): Color code for text inside the bar.
        align (str): "left", "right", or "center" - alignment of text in the bar
        pre_text (str): Text to put before the numbers in the bar
        post_text (str): Text to put after the numbers in the bar
        show_values (bool): If true, shows the numerical values represented by
            the bar. It's highly recommended you keep this on, especially if
            there's no info given in pre_text or post_text, as players on screen
            readers will be unable to read the graphical aspect of the bar.
