"""
Slow Exit typeclass

Contribution - Griatch 2014


This is an example of an Exit-type that delays its traversal.This
simulates slow movement, common in many different types of games. The
contrib also contains two commands, CmdSetSpeed and CmdStop for changing
the movement speed and abort an ongoing traversal, respectively.

To try out an exit of this type, you could connect two existing rooms
using something like this:

@open north:contrib.slow_exit.SlowExit = <destination>


Installation:

To make this your new default exit, modify mygame/typeclasses/exits.py
to import this module and change the default Exit class to inherit
from SlowExit instead.

To get the ability to change your speed and abort your movement,
simply import and add CmdSetSpeed and CmdStop from this module to your
default cmdset (see tutorials on how to do this if you are unsure).

Notes:

This implementation is efficient but not persistent; so incomplete
movement will be lost in a server reload. This is acceptable for most
game types - to simulate longer travel times (more than the couple of
seconds assumed here), a more persistent variant using Scripts or the
TickerHandler might be better.
