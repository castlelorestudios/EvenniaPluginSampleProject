This is a simple gender-aware Character class for allowing users to
insert custom markers in their text to indicate gender-aware
messaging. It relies on a modified msg() and is meant as an
inspiration and starting point to how to do stuff like this.

When in use, all messages being sent to the character will make use of
the character's gender, for example the echo

```
char.msg("%s falls on |p face with a thud." % char.key)
```

will result in "Tom falls on his|her|its|their face with a thud"
depending on the gender of the object being messaged. Default gender
is "ambiguous" (they).

To use, have DefaultCharacter inherit from this, or change
setting.DEFAULT_CHARACTER to point to this class.

The `@gender` command needs to be added to the default cmdset before
it becomes available.
