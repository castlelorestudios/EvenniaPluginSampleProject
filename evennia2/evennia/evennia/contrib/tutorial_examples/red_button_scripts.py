# Scripts as state-managers
#
# Scripts have many uses, one of which is to statically
# make changes when a particular state of an object changes.
# There is no "timer" involved in this case (although there could be),
# whenever the script determines it is "invalid", it simply shuts down
# along with all the things it controls.
#
# To show as many features as possible of the script and cmdset systems,
# we will use three scripts controlling one state each of the red_button,
# each with its own set of commands, handled by cmdsets - one for when
# the button has its lid open, and one for when it is closed and a
# last one for when the player pushed the button and gets blinded by
# a bright light. The last one also has a timer component that allows it
# to remove itself after a while (and the player recovers their eyesight).
