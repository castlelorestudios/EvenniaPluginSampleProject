Example script for testing. This adds a simple timer that has your
character make observations and notices at irregular intervals.

To test, use
  @script me = tutorial_examples.bodyfunctions.BodyFunctions

The script will only send messages to the object it is stored on, so
make sure to put it on yourself or you won't see any messages!
