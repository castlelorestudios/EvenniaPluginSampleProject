# Evennia Game Index Client

Greg Taylor 2016

This contrib features a client for the [Evennia Game Index]
(http://evennia-game-index.appspot.com/), a listing of games built on
Evennia. By listing your game on the index, you make it easy for other
people in the community to discover your creation.

*Note: Since this is still an early experiment, there is no notion of
ownership for a game listing. As a consequence, we rely on the good behavior
of our users in the early goings. If the index is a success, we'll work
on remedying this.*

## Listing your Game

To list your game, you'll need to enable the Evennia Game Index client.
Start by `cd`'ing to your game directory. From there, open up
`server/conf/server_services_plugins.py`. It might look something like this
if you don't have any other optional add-ons enabled:

```python
"""
Server plugin services

This plugin module can define user-created services for the Server to
start.

This module must handle all imports and setups required to start a
twisted service (see examples in evennia.server.server). It must also
contain a function start_plugin_services(application). Evennia will
call this function with the main Server application (so your services
can be added to it). The function should not return anything. Plugin
services are started last in the Server startup process.
"""


def start_plugin_services(server):
    """
    This hook is called by Evennia, last in the Server startup process.

    server - a reference to the main server application.
    """
    pass
```

To enable the client, import `EvenniaGameIndexService` and fire it up after the
Evennia server has finished starting:

```python
"""
Server plugin services

This plugin module can define user-created services for the Server to
start.

This module must handle all imports and setups required to start a
twisted service (see examples in evennia.server.server). It must also
contain a function start_plugin_services(application). Evennia will
call this function with the main Server application (so your services
can be added to it). The function should not return anything. Plugin
services are started last in the Server startup process.
"""

from evennia.contrib.egi_client import EvenniaGameIndexService

def start_plugin_services(server):
    """
    This hook is called by Evennia, last in the Server startup process.

    server - a reference to the main server application.
    """
    egi_service = EvenniaGameIndexService()
    server.services.addService(egi_service)
```

Next, configure your game listing by opening up `server/conf/settings.py` and
 using the following as a starting point:

```python
######################################################################
# Contrib config
######################################################################

GAME_INDEX_LISTING = {
    'game_status': 'pre-alpha',
    # Optional, comment out or remove if N/A
    'game_website': 'http://my-game.com',
    'short_description': 'This is my game. It is fun. You should play it.',
    # Optional but highly recommended. Markdown is supported.
    'long_description': (
        "Hello, there. You silly person.\n\n"
        "This is the start of a new paragraph. Markdown is cool. Isn't this "
        "[neat](http://evennia.com)? My game is best game. Woohoo!\n\n"
        "Time to wrap this up. One final paragraph for the road."
    ),
    'listing_contact': 'me@my-game.com',
    # At minimum, specify this or the web_client_url options. Both is fine, too.
    'telnet_hostname': 'my-game.com',
    'telnet_port': 1234,
    # At minimum, specify this or the telnet_* options. Both is fine, too.
    'web_client_url': 'http://my-game.com/webclient',
}
```

The following section in this README.md will go over all possible values.

At this point, you should be all set! Simply restart your game and check the
server logs for errors. Your listing and some game state will be sent every
half hour.

## What information is being reported?

In addition the the details listed in the previous section, we send some
simple usage stats that don't currently get displayed. These will help the
Evennia maintainers get a feel for some technical specifics for games out in
the wild.

## Troubleshooting

### My game doesn't appear on the listing!

If you don't see your game appear on the listing after reloading your server, 
check the server logs. You should see some error messages describing what
went wrong.

### I changed my game name and now there are two entries

This is a side-effect of our current, naive implementation in our listing
system. Your old entry will disappear within two hours. Alternatively,
speak up on IRC and someone might be able to manually purge the old entry.
