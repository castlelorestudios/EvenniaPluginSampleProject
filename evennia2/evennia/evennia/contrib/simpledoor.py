SimpleDoor

Contribution - Griatch 2016

A simple two-way exit that represents a door that can be opened and
closed. Can easily be expanded from to make it lockable, destroyable
etc.  Note that the simpledoor is based on Evennia locks, so it will
not work for a superuser (which bypasses all locks) - the superuser
will always appear to be able to close/open the door over and over
without the locks stopping you. To use the door, use `@quell` or a
non-superuser account.

Installation:

    Import this module in mygame/commands/default_cmdsets and add
    the CmdOpen and CmdOpenCloseDoor commands to the CharacterCmdSet;
    then reload the server.

To try it out, `@dig` a new room and then use the (overloaded) `@open`
commmand to open a new doorway to it like this:

    @open doorway:contrib.simpledoor.SimpleDoor = otherroom

You can then use `open doorway' and `close doorway` to change the open
state. If you are not superuser (`@quell` yourself) you'll find you
cannot pass through either side of the door once it's closed from the
other side.
