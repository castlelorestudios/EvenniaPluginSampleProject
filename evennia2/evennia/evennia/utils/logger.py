Logging facilities

These are thin wrappers on top of Twisted's logging facilities; logs
are all directed either to stdout (if Evennia is running in
interactive mode) or to $GAME_DIR/server/logs.

The log_file() function uses its own threading system to log to
arbitrary files in $GAME_DIR/server/logs.

Note: All logging functions have two aliases, log_type() and
log_typemsg(). This is for historical, back-compatible reasons.
