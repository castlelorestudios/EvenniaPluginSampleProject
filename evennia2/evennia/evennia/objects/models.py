"""
This module defines the database models for all in-game objects, that
is, all objects that has an actual existence in-game.

Each database object is 'decorated' with a 'typeclass', a normal
python class that implements all the various logics needed by the game
in question. Objects created of this class transparently communicate
with its related database object for storing all attributes. The
admin should usually not have to deal directly with this database
object layer.

Attributes are separate objects that store values persistently onto
the database object. Like everything else, they can be accessed
transparently through the decorating TypeClass.

    All objects in the game use the ObjectDB model to store
    data in the database. This is handled transparently through
    the typeclass system.

    Note that the base objectdb is very simple, with
    few defined fields. Use attributes to extend your
    type class with new database-stored variables.

    The TypedObject supplies the following (inherited) properties:

      - key - main name
      - name - alias for key
      - db_typeclass_path - the path to the decorating typeclass
      - db_date_created - time stamp of object creation
      - permissions - perm strings
      - locks - lock definitions (handler)
      - dbref - #id of object
      - db - persistent attribute storage
      - ndb - non-persistent attribute storage

    The ObjectDB adds the following properties:

      - account - optional connected account (always together with sessid)
      - sessid - optional connection session id (always together with account)
      - location - in-game location of object
      - home - safety location for object (handler)
      - scripts - scripts assigned to object (handler from typeclass)
      - cmdset - active cmdset on object (handler from typeclass)
      - aliases - aliases for this object (property)
      - nicks - nicknames for *other* things in Evennia (handler)
      - sessions - sessions connected to this object (see also account)
      - has_account - bool if an active account is currently connected
      - contents - other objects having this object as location
      - exits - exits from this object
