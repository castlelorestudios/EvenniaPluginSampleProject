"""

A Command Set (CmdSet) holds a set of commands. The Cmdsets can be
merged and combined to create new sets of commands in a
non-destructive way. This makes them very powerful for implementing
custom game states where different commands (or different variations
of commands) are available to the accounts depending on circumstance.

The available merge operations are partly borrowed from mathematical
Set theory.


* Union The two command sets are merged so that as many commands as
    possible of each cmdset ends up in the merged cmdset. Same-name
    commands are merged by priority.  This is the most common default.
    Ex: A1,A3 + B1,B2,B4,B5 = A1,B2,A3,B4,B5
* Intersect - Only commands found in *both* cmdsets (i.e. which have
    same names) end up in the merged cmdset, with the higher-priority
    cmdset replacing the lower one. Ex: A1,A3 + B1,B2,B4,B5 = A1
* Replace -   The commands of this cmdset completely replaces the
    lower-priority cmdset's commands, regardless of if same-name commands
    exist. Ex: A1,A3 + B1,B2,B4,B5 = A1,A3
* Remove -    This removes the relevant commands from the
    lower-priority cmdset completely.  They are not replaced with
    anything, so this in effects uses the high-priority cmdset as a filter
    to affect the low-priority cmdset.  Ex: A1,A3 + B1,B2,B4,B5 = B2,B4,B5

                    Ex: A1,A3 + B1,B2,B4,B5 = A1,A3
        Remove -    This removes the relevant commands from the
                    lower-priority cmdset completely.  They are not

                    high-priority cmdset as a filter to affect the
                    low-priority cmdset.
                    Ex: A1,A3 + B1,B2,B4,B5 = B2,B4,B5

                 Note: Commands longer than 2 characters and starting
                       with double underscrores, like '__noinput_command'
                       are considered 'system commands' and are
                       excempt from all merge operations - they are
                       ALWAYS included across mergers and only affected
                       if same-named system commands replace them.

    priority- All cmdsets are always merged in pairs of two so that
              the higher set's mergetype is applied to the
              lower-priority cmdset. Default commands have priority 0,
              high-priority ones like Exits and Channels have 10 and 9.
              Priorities can be negative as well to give default
              commands preference.

    duplicates - determines what happens when two sets of equal
                 priority merge. Default has the first of them in the
                 merger (i.e. A above) automatically taking
                 precedence. But if allow_duplicates is true, the
                 result will be a merger with more than one of each
                 name match.  This will usually lead to the account
                 receiving a multiple-match error higher up the road,
                 but can be good for things like cmdsets on non-account
                 objects in a room, to allow the system to warn that
                 more than one 'ball' in the room has the same 'kick'
                 command defined on it, so it may offer a chance to
                 select which ball to kick ...  Allowing duplicates
                 only makes sense for Union and Intersect, the setting
                 is ignored for the other mergetypes.

    key_mergetype (dict) - allows the cmdset to define a unique
             mergetype for particular cmdsets.  Format is
             {CmdSetkeystring:mergetype}. Priorities still apply.
             Example: {'Myevilcmdset','Replace'} which would make
             sure for this set to always use 'Replace' on
             Myevilcmdset no matter what overall mergetype this set
             has.

    no_objs  - don't include any commands from nearby objects
                  when searching for suitable commands
    no_exits  - ignore the names of exits when matching against
                        commands
    no_channels   - ignore the name of channels when matching against
                        commands (WARNING- this is dangerous since the
                        account can then not even ask staff for help if
                        something goes wrong)
