    This function is called by the cmdhandler once it has
    gathered and merged all valid cmdsets valid for this particular parsing.

    Args:
        raw_string (str): The unparsed text entered by the caller.
        cmdset (CmdSet): The merged, currently valid cmdset
        caller (Session, Account or Object): The caller triggering this parsing.
        match_index (int, optional): Index to pick a given match in a
            list of same-named command matches. If this is given, it suggests
            this is not the first time this function was called: normally
            the first run resulted in a multimatch, and the index is given
            to select between the results for the second run.

    Notes:
        The cmdparser understand the following command combinations (where
        [] marks optional parts.

        ```
        [cmdname[ cmdname2 cmdname3 ...] [the rest]
        ```

        A command may consist of any number of space-separated words of any
        length, and contain any character. It may also be empty.

        The parser makes use of the cmdset to find command candidates. The
        parser return a list of matches. Each match is a tuple with its
        first three elements being the parsed cmdname (lower case),
        the remaining arguments, and the matched cmdobject from the cmdset.

        Builds a command match by splitting the incoming string and
        evaluating the quality of the match.

        Args:
            cmdname (str): Name of command to check for.
            string (str): The string to match against.
            cmdobj (str): The full Command instance.
            raw_cmdname (str, optional): If CMD_IGNORE_PREFIX is set and the cmdname starts with
                one of the prefixes to ignore, this contains the raw, unstripped cmdname,
