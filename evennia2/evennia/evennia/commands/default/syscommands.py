System commands

These are the default commands called by the system commandhandler
when various exceptions occur. If one of these commands are not
implemented and part of the current cmdset, the engine falls back
to a default solution instead.

Some system commands are shown in this module
as a REFERENCE only (they are not all added to Evennia's
default cmdset since they don't currently do anything differently from the
default backup systems hard-wired in the engine).

Overloading these commands in a cmdset can be used to create
interesting effects. An example is using the NoMatch system command
to implement a line-editor where you don't have to start each
line with a command (if there is no match to a known command,
the line is just added to the editor buffer).
