        This method is called by the cmdhandler once the command name
        has been identified. It creates a new set of member variables
        that can be later accessed from self.func() (see below)

        The following variables are available for our use when entering this
        method (from the command definition, and assigned on the fly by the
        cmdhandler):
           self.key - the name of this command ('look')
           self.aliases - the aliases of this cmd ('l')
           self.permissions - permission string for this command
           self.help_category - overall category of command

           self.caller - the object calling this command
           self.cmdstring - the actual command name used to call this
                            (this allows you to know which alias was used,
                             for example)
           self.args - the raw input; everything following self.cmdstring.
           self.cmdset - the cmdset from which this command was picked. Not
                         often used (useful for commands like 'help' or to
                         list all available commands etc)
           self.obj - the object on which this command was defined. It is often
                         the same as self.caller.

        A MUX command has the following possible syntax:

          name[ with several words][/switch[/switch..]] arg1[,arg2,...] [[=|,] arg[,..]]

        The 'name[ with several words]' part is already dealt with by the
        cmdhandler at this point, and stored in self.cmdname (we don't use
        it here). The rest of the command is stored in self.args, which can
        start with the switch indicator /.

        Optional variables to aid in parsing, if set:
          self.switch_options  - (tuple of valid /switches expected by this
                                  command (without the /))
          self.rhs_split       - Alternate string delimiter or tuple of strings
                                 to separate left/right hand sides. tuple form
                                 gives priority split to first string delimiter.

        This parser breaks self.args into its constituents and stores them in the
        following variables:
          self.switches = [list of /switches (without the /)]
          self.raw = This is the raw argument input, including switches
          self.args = This is re-defined to be everything *except* the switches
          self.lhs = Everything to the left of = (lhs:'left-hand side'). If
                     no = is found, this is identical to self.args.
          self.rhs: Everything to the right of = (rhs:'right-hand side').
                    If no '=' is found, this is None.
          self.lhslist - [self.lhs split into a list by comma]
          self.rhslist - [list of self.rhs split into a list by comma]
          self.arglist = [list of space-separated args (stripped, including '=' if it exists)]

          All args and list members are stripped of excess whitespace around the
          strings, but case is preserved.
