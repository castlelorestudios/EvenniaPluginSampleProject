Settings and actions for the dummyrunner

This module defines dummyrunner settings and sets up
the actions available to dummy accounts.

The settings are global variables:

TIMESTEP - time in seconds between each 'tick'
CHANCE_OF_ACTION - chance 0-1 of action happening
CHANCE_OF_LOGIN - chance 0-1 of login happening
TELNET_PORT - port to use, defaults to settings.TELNET_PORT
ACTIONS - see below

ACTIONS is a tuple

(login_func, logout_func, (0.3, func1), (0.1, func2) ... )

where the first entry is the function to call on first connect, with a
chance of occurring given by CHANCE_OF_LOGIN. This function is usually
responsible for logging in the account. The second entry is always
called when the dummyrunner disconnects from the server and should
thus issue a logout command.  The other entries are tuples (chance,
func). They are picked randomly, their commonality based on the
cumulative chance given (the chance is normalized between all options
so if will still work also if the given chances don't add up to 1).
Since each function can return a list of game-command strings, each
function may result in multiple operations.

An action-function is called with a "client" argument which is a
reference to the dummy client currently performing the action. It
returns a string or a list of command strings to execute.  Use the
client object for optionally saving data between actions.

The client object has the following relevant properties and methods:
  key - an optional client key. This is only used for dummyrunner output.
        Default is "Dummy-<cid>"
  cid - client id
  gid - globally unique id, hashed with time stamp
  istep - the current step
  exits - an empty list. Can be used to store exit names
  objs - an empty list. Can be used to store object names
  counter() - returns a unique increasing id, hashed with time stamp
              to make it unique also between dummyrunner instances.

The return should either be a single command string or a tuple of
command strings. This list of commands will always be executed every
TIMESTEP with a chance given by CHANCE_OF_ACTION by in the order given
(no randomness) and allows for setting up a more complex chain of
commands (such as creating an account and logging in).

# This is a tuple of client action functions. The first element is the
# function the client should use to log into the game and move to
# STARTROOM . The second element is the logout command, for cleanly
# exiting the mud. The following elements are 2-tuples of (probability,
# action_function). The probablities should normally sum up to 1,
# otherwise the system will normalize them.
